In this code guide you can build an attractive calculator project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I have used pre build javascript evaluate function. Its a very simple calulater that allows you to perform just Arthmetic operation. i-e: +,-,/ and *.
Also you can delete or clear the screen by using AC or DEL button.
